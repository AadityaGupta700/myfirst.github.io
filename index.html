        <p>Paneer is prepared by adding food acid, such as lemon juice, vinegar, citric acid or dahi (yogurt),[16] to hot milk to separate the curds from the whey. The curds are drained in muslin or cheesecloth and the excess water is pressed out. The resulting paneer is dipped in chilled water for 2–3 hours to improve its texture and appearance.

        <p>
            Naan in parts of the Indian subcontinent usually refers to a specific kind of thick flatbread. Generally, it is usually leavened with yeast or with bread starter (leavened naan dough left over from a previous batch); unleavened dough (similar to that used for roti) is also used. Naan, similar to some other breads of South Asian cuisine is cooked in a tandoor, from which tandoori cooking takes its name.

        <span id="r">Rasgulla</span>
        <p >While the origin story of this treat is hotly contested in some circles, I know rasgulla to be a famous Bengali sweet made from milk.

            To make rasgulla recipe, milk is curdled and drained of whey to make chenna, which is essentially a fresh cottage cheese.
            
            The chenna is then kneaded with some semolina(rava or suji) or all purpose flour (maida). Round balls are made from the kneaded chenna, which are then cooked in sugar syrup.
